# Bugbank e2e Tests
## Using Cypress with cucumber to automated testes



I started this project to pratice my Cypress habilities, and learn how to use cucumber (to write BDD tests)
- I am using a site that is made for tests
- I don't used typescript because ins't the focus
- I don't enjoy using the BDD with cypress this way
- I thing that working with work flows and context will be much simples

## How to run

- install the dependencies with 'npm install'
- run 'npm run test'

## The only test that exists, isn't working:
> -  I don't now if the problem is in the website, or in me selector, but, Cypress says that are two elements 'input - email'
